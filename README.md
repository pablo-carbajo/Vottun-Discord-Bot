# Vottun-Discord-Bot


A Discord bot wrote with Python and that uses both OpenSea's and Etherscan's APIs. This bot lets you track the latest transactions for the Vottun token and display some useful information(e.g. market cap, floor price, total supply, eth price, gas fee, transaction history, display token owner, ...etc). 

This repository is still in development ahead of Vottun's token launch further in 2022.
